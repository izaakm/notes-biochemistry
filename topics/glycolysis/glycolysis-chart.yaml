- step: 1
  enzyme: hexokinase
  type: transferase
  type_info: Transfers P from ATP to glucose because direct phosphorylation of glucose is thermodynamically unfavorable. (Kinases that use ATP require Mg+; interacts with [negatively charged] ATP to stabilize it and allows for nucleophilic attack of the glucose onto 3P of ATP.)
  rationale: | # markdown
    - Phosphorylation of glucose traps glucose in the cell.
    - First step of glycolysis but NOT first committed step for glycolysis.
    - Conformational change to hexokinase when glucose binds ...
        1. Forms a binding pocket for ATP and the active site.
        2. Excludes water from the active site.
        3. Brings ATP and glucose in close proximity to one another.
  thermodynamics:
    1: 
        - glucose + Pi -> G6P + H2O
        - 14
        - 20
    2: 
        - ATP + H2O -> ADP + Pi
        - -35.5
        - -54.8
    overall: 
        - Glucose + ATP -> G6P + ADP
        - -16.5
        - -34.8
  regulation: | # markdown
    - Very highly thermodynamically favorable reaction; tf, must be regulated.
    - Use of G6P also must be regulated bc it is a branch point ... G6P:
        - Glycogen
        - Fructose 6P (glycolysis)
        - Pentose P Pathway (NADPH)
    - Product inhibition: hexokinase is inhibited by G6P (ie, the reaction product).
    - Inactivation of hexokinase makes it so glucose cannot diffuse into the cell (glucose travels into the cell via facilitated diffusion). By phosphorylating glucose [Gluc] goes down and [Gluc-P] goes up in the cell, increasing diffusion of glucose into the cell [by creating a chemical gradient].
  comment: First use of ATP.

- step: 2
  enzyme: phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)
  type: isomerase
  rationale: | # markdown
    Must perform an isomeration because:
    
    - In the next step, phosphofructokinase phosphorylates C1; it is much easier to phosphorylate C1 of fructose than glucose.
    - The next step is an aldolase cleavage, which requires the carbonyl group to be on C2 of the 6 C sugar. Otherwise, we wouldn't get two 3C molecules (instead, would yield one 4C and one 2C); ie, this allows for cleavage into 2 symmetric molecules.
  thermodynamics:
    overall:
        - G6P <=> F6P
        - 2
        - -2
    comment: readily reversible (can participate in glycolysis AND gluconeogenesis)
  regulation: none

- step: 3
  enzyme: phosphofructokinase (PFK1)
  type: transferase
  type_info: | # markdown
    - Transfers P from ATP to glucose bc the transfer of P to glucose is thermodynamically unfavorable. [???]
    - Attaches 2nd phosphate to fructose.
  rationale: | # markdown
    Main control point for glycolysis; **rate determining step** => rate at which PFK catalyzes its rxn determines rate of entire pathway.
    First *committed* step of glycolysis.
  thermodynamics:
    1: 
        - F6P + Pi -> F-1,6-BP + H2O
        - 16
        - 36
    2: 
        - ATP + H2O -> ADP + Pi
        - -30.5
        - -18.8
    overall:
        - F6P + ATP -> F-1,6-BP + ADP
  regulation: | # markdown
    - Very highly thermodynamically favorable rxn; tf, must be regulated.
    - Main control point for glycolysis => rate determining step.
    - Allosteric enzyme:
        - Positive effectors
            - AMP/ADP
            - F-2,6-BP
        - Negative effectors
            - ATP
            - Citrate (first product of TCA cycle)
    - Controlled by "energy charge":
        - ATP (-ve), AMP/ADP (+ve) are allosteric effectors.
        - Catabolic pathway => ATP regenerating pathway (goal is to make ATP)
    - Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP) is a secondary metabolite that is synthesized just to regulate PFK (and F-1,6-BP); tf, it regulates both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.
        - Positive regulator (activates glucose breakdown in glycolysis), bc [gluc] is high ... need to process it.
        - F-2,6-BP is formed from PFK2 (PFK1 phosphorylates C1 of fructose; PFK2 phosphorylates C2 of fructose).
    - Conditions
        - High [gluc] activates glycolysis and inhibits gluconeogenesis.
        - PFK2 dephosphorylated is a kinase: F6P -> F-2,6-BP
        - High [gluc] => high [F6P]: some of [pathway intermediate] is convert to regulator.
        - Low [gluc] inhibits glycolysis and activates gluconeogensis.
        - PFK2 phosphorylated is a phosphatase and remove Pi from F-2,6-BP (H2O -> Pi).
  comment: Second use of ATP.

- step: 4
  enzyme: aldolase
  type: lyase
  type_info: cleaves single bond to form new double bond (=O).
  rationale: | # markdown
    - Re: Phosphoglucose isomerase ... C=O must be at C2 bc need to cleave into 2 symmetric molecules.
  thermodynamics:
    overall:
        - F-1,6-BP <=> GAP + DHAP
        - 24
        - 0
    comment: |
        Near equilibrium in cell, [GAP] are kept low so rxn is pushed in foreward direction.
  regulation: none

- step: 5
  enzyme: triose phosphate isomerase (TIM)
  type: isomerase
  rationale: Converts DHAP to GAP.
  thermodynamics:
    overall:
        - DHAP <=> GAP
        - 7.5
        - 0
    comment: Near equilibrium in cell, [GAP] is low, so reaction favors formation of GAP from DHAP.
  regulation: none
  comment: | # markdown
    Last step in stage 1 of glycolysis.

- step: 6
  enzyme: glyceraldehyde-3P dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
  type: oxidoreductase
  type_info: NAD+ (oxidized) -> NADH (reduced)
  rationale: | # markdown
    - Generate a high energy phosphate compound (1,3-BPG) to transfer a Pi to ADP (later).
    - Converts GAP to 1,3-BPG.
    - 1,3-BPG = first *high energy* compound
    - Uses NAD+ as cofactor, generating NADH (reduction). *This is also an energy capture step*; energy goes into electron transport chain (ETC).
    - Incorporates Pi into new compound; difficult to do alone, must use add'l energy from oxidation.
    - Acylphosphates = high energy compounds used to phosphorylate ADP -> ATP.
  thermodynamics:
    1: 
        - GAP + NAD+ <=> 3PG + NADH + H+
        - -41.3
    2:
        - 3PG + Pi <=> 1,3-BPG + H2O
        - 49.4
    overall:
        - GAP + NAD+ + Pi <=> 1,3-BPG + NADH + H+
        - 6.3
        - 0
    comment: This (overall) reaction is ~at equilibrium bc it is coupled with the next reaction (step 7).
  regulation: none
  comment: | # markdown
    - First step in Stage 2 of glycolysis.
    - Here, 1,3-BPG is created.
    - 2,3-BPG is negative hemoglobin regulator made from 1,3-BPG.
    - Within RBCs, there is a phosphoglycerate mutase that converts 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG (another enzyme converts 2,3-BPG to 3BPG [???] as necessary to regulated hemoglobin).
    - Tf, [2,3-BPG] in RBCs depends on glycolysis.
    - Glycolysis deficiencies affect O2 delivery:
        - Hexokinase deficiency (beginning of glycolysis) => decrease [2,3-BPG] => increase O2 binding.
        - Pyruvate kinase deficiency (end of glycolysis) => increase [1,3-BPG] => increase [2,3-BPG] => decrease O2 binding.

- step: 7
  enzyme: phosphyglycerate kinase (PGK)
  type:
  rationale: | # markdown
    - Formation of 1st ATP.
    - Takes acyl phosphate group off of 1,3-BPG, transfers it to ADP.
    - Substrate level phosphorylation (individual enzyme uses a substrate to phosphorylate ADP to ATP).
    - For every 1 glucose molecule, we get 2 molecules of 1,3-BPG, so this "step" generates 2 ATP (bc it happens once for each 1,3-BPG).
  thermodynamics:
    overall:
        - 1,3-BPG + ADP <=> 3PG + ATP
        - -18.8
    comment: |
        GAPDH and PGK work together by *substrate channeling*.
        These enzymes are physically associated with each other; GAPDH rxn is overall unfavorable, PGK favorable.
        The end product of GAPDH is immediately passed to PGK; combined rxn occurs more quickly; "extra" energy from PGK is "donated" to GAPDH, enabling GAPDH to proceed forward.

        1. GAP + NAD+ + Pi       <=> 1,3-BPG + NADH + H+    (GAPDH)
        2. 1,3-BPG + ADP         <=> 3PG + ATP              (PGK)
        3. GAP + NAD+ + ADP + Pi <=> 3PGA + ATP + NADH + H+ (overall)
  regulation: none
  comment: Unregulated bc needs to pass some energy to GAPDH (previous enzyme) and phosphoglycerate mutase (next enzyme).

- step: 8
  enzyme: phosphoglycertae mutase (PGM)
  type: isomerase (mutase)
  type_info: Mutase => migration of functional group.
  rationale: | # markdown
    - Must convert to 2PG in order to create PEP.
    - PGM has phosphorylated histidine in the active site, which is transferred to C2 of 3PG to create 2PG. [TODO] Need to clarify this ... the histidine transfers the function group, the histidine is not itself transferred.
  thermodynamics:
    overall:
        - 3PG <=> 2PG
        - 5
        - 0
    comment: Also coupled to PGK to help it to equilibrium.
  regulation: none

- step: 9
  enzyme: enolase
  type: lyase
  type_info: removes water to form double bond.
  rationale: | # markdown
    - Creates 2nd high energy compound (phosphoenolpyruvate, PEP).
  thermodynamics:
    overall:
        - 2PG <=> PEP
        - 2
        - -2
  regulation: none

- step: 10
  enzyme: pyruvate kinase (PK)
  type: 
  rationale: | # markdown
    - Take phosphate off of PEP and add it to ADP (ADP -> ATP).
  thermodynamics:
    1: 
        - PEP + H2O -> Pyruvate + Pi
        - -61.9
    2:
        - Pi + ADP -> ATP + H2O
        - -30.5
    overall:
        - PEP + ADP -> Pyruvate + ATP
        - -31.4
        - -16.7
    comment: | # markdown
        Hydrolysis of Pi off of PEP only gives -16 kJ/mol of energy, but pyruvate is tautomerized from enol to keto forms, providing add'l -46 kJ/mol for total of -61.9 kJ/mol.
